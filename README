Showcase of YetAnotherTown, a work-in-progress city builder. There is a functional terraforming and road-building system. This repository contains some images of the project; no code or demo can be provided yet, as the project is still in an early stage.

Current features:
    1. LOD-based terrain rendering: Draw terrain chunks at a lower resolution depending on how far away they are from the camera.
    2. Terraforming tools: flattening, smoothing, raising, sloping.
    3. Cubic Bézier–based road drawing: Draw a cubic Bézier curve and the system will automatically integrate it into the current road network; new intersections and geometry will be computed accordingly.
